# aws
general aws learning, tips, etc

first of all, some aws vs azure impressions - 
aws is cheaper, but harder to figure out how to use correctly. azure (for a windows/.net developer) is much more easier to transition to, but more expensive. 

you have know a lot about differents parts of aws to make good use of it... many little things. Aws documentation is not all update to date. Old examples don't work in quite some cases I ran into. Example - Using API gateway to access dynamodb directly; took me quite a while to find the right informaton, trials and errors to get it working.
